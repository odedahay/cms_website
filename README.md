# CMS Blog - Built with the MEAN Stack

Welcome to the CMS Blog project! This is a Content Management System (CMS) designed to provide a robust platform for creating, managing, and publishing blog posts. Built using the **MEAN Stack** (MySQL, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js), this project demonstrates the power of full-stack JavaScript development.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Blog Management**: Create, edit, delete, and publish blog posts.
- **Rich Text Editor**: Write and format blog content with ease.
- **Database Integration**: Store and retrieve data using MongoDB.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI built with Angular.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API built with Express.js and Node.js.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular and scalable codebase for future enhancements.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular (TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MYSQL (with Sequelize ORM)
- **Other Tools**:
  - Sequelize for database modeling
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Nodemon for development server monitoring
  - ts-node for running TypeScript directly
